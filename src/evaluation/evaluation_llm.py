Your task is to compare the model’s answer to the reference answer, and decide whether the model’s answer is factually correct (1) or incorrect (0).
		•	The reference answer represents the factual truth.
	•	The model’s answer must include all key facts and meaning from the reference.
	•	It is acceptable if the model adds extra relevant details, as long as the reference content is accurately and clearly expressed.
	•	The answer must be semantically correct, complete, and not contradict the reference.
	•	Slight rewording is allowed if the truth of the reference answer remains fully preserved.
	•	Do not give credit for partial correctness or vague overlap — the model must clearly and truthfully answer the original question in line with the reference.

	Only output the digit 1 or 0. Do not explain your reasoning.
